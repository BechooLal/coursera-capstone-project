Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening any business place like Grocery Store in Vancouver City, Canada.\n\nThe first task would be to choose the safest borough by analysing crime data for opening a grocery store and short listing a neighbourhood, where grocery stores are not amongst the most commom venues, and yet as close to the city as possible.\n\nWe will make use of our data science tools to analyse data and focus on the safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood where grocery store is not amongst the most common venue can be selected."
